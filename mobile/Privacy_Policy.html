<p class="p1">PRIVACY POLICY</p>
<p class="p2">www.swingersaroundme.com ("SWINGERS AROUND ME") is committed to protecting the privacy of users of its products and services. Questions regarding this statement should be directed to SWINGERS AROUND ME by contacting us at the address listed at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Information Disclosure</b></p>
<p class="p2">This statement outlines the privacy practices of SWINGERS AROUND ME. We have clearly marked SWINGERS AROUND ME web sites with our logos and/or copyright notices so you know where this policy applies. It does not apply to any other companies' or organizations' web sites to which we link, and you should check their privacy policies when visiting their sites. The only personally identifiable information collected by SWINGERS AROUND ME is information that you provide voluntarily. Other than that, SWINGERS AROUND ME collects only mechanical information necessary to manage and enhance the user experience and to create statistics of general, non-user-specific information. SWINGERS AROUND ME collects some information about general usage of the sites through a technology tool called a "cookie." SWINGERS AROUND ME uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. Persistent cookies remain after you close your browser for subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears when you close your browser. As with any cookie, if you do not want a cookie set then you need to disable your cookies setting in your browser. Please be aware that doing so may disable your ability to stay logged in to the Service and to use other aspects of our site.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Links</b></p>
<p class="p2">SWINGERS AROUND ME web sites, and the Service, contain links to other web sites. Please note that when you click on one of these links you are clicking to another web site. SWINGERS AROUND ME has no responsibility for anything on any web site to which you link. SWINGERS AROUND ME allows other companies, including, but not limited to, third-party ad servers and ad networks, to serve advertisements within SWINGERS AROUND ME web sites. These third-party ad servers and ad networks use technology to display the advertisements and links that appear on the Service and on SWINGERS AROUND ME web sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to geo-specify the advertising content you see. SWINGERS AROUND ME does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-parties without your consent other than broad demographic groupings, or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks SWINGERS AROUND ME to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, single males ages 30-35) or audience segment (for example, single males ages 30-35 who have viewed certain categories of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach, even though SWINGERS AROUND ME has not given them any information about you personally. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of SWINGERS AROUND ME web sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you. If you click on any advertisement, and visit a non-SWINGERS AROUND ME web site, you should review the privacy policies of these web sites for more information on their practices. SWINGERS AROUND MEâ€™s Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, any such web sites.</p>
