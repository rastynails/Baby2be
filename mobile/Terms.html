Like them, we do not monitor communications of any type. People may publish any content they want. However, we do set forth standards of behavior. Any user found to be violating these standards may have action taken against them without notice which ranges from deletion of Content, to deletion of entire profiles, to being barred from the Service, and even to referrals to law enforcement authorities. And while SWINGERS AROUND ME does not formally moderate the Service, we may at our discretion review member profile text, photos, images, audio and video, and we may randomly or specifically review comments, blogs, forums, email, parties, communities, events and other Content, including those which are otherwise password protected to or hidden from the general public to check for compliance with the standards stated herein; that SWINGERS AROUND ME may do this, User agrees that this does not in any way form an obligation or expectation that SWINGERS AROUND ME will do this and, as such, User will not place any reliance on SWINGERS AROUND ME to moderate or otherwise keep the Service void of any illegal, illicit or otherwise objectionable Content. SWINGERS AROUND ME assumes no responsibility for any Content, no obligation to modify or remove any inappropriate Content, and no responsibility for the conduct of any user ("user" includes you, it includes other members, and includes non-members who are accessing and possibly even contributing Content). The Service contains multi-user, participatory services, including but not limited to forums, blogs, chat rooms, cam rooms, games, communities, contests, events, parties and invitations, and other message and communication facilities ("Forums" and “Blogs”) that may provide you and other users an opportunity to submit, upload, post, display, transmit and/or exchange information, ideas, opinions, information, files, messages, transmissions and Content with other users. SWINGERS AROUND ME Services permit the submission of videos, photos, text and other communications submitted by you and other users ("Submissions") and the hosting, sharing, and/or publishing of such Submissions.

Forums, as well as all other aspects of the Service, including your ip address, are not guaranteed to be secure or private and you should assume your Content, information and submissions can be read and even copied by others, with or without your knowledge or permission.

Your use of the Service is at your own risk. SWINGERS AROUND ME does not endorse and has no control over the Content and SWINGERS AROUND ME expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with user Submissions. You understand that when using the Service, you will be exposed to Submissions from a variety of sources, and that SWINGERS AROUND ME is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such Submissions. You use the Service solely at your own risk, you are solely responsible for the Content that you post on or through any of the Service, and any material or information that you transmit to other users and for your interactions with other Users.

So don't take it for more than it is. We don't retain records of certifications, nor supporting data. This is simply another non-moderated feature of the Service. SWINGERS AROUND ME assumes absolutely no liability for any problems that arise out of any reliance on the "verified" feature of the Service.</p>
